# Astro 497 Lab 4

## Exercise 1:  Model Building II:  Assessment
- Work through ex1.jl  (a Pluto notebook)

## Goals
In this lab, students will learn to:
- Assess evidence for planets based on Transit Timing Variations (TTVs)
- Assess the quality of a model that has been fit to data
- Build a more complex model based on results of analysis with a simpler model  
- Fit a non-linear model to data

Students will strengthen their understanding of:
- Transit timing variations
- Residual analysis
- Using named parameters/named tuples to reduce risk of programming errors
